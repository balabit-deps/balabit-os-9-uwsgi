 uwsgidecorators is a simple Python module that exports a bunch of decorators
 to allow a more elegant approach to uWSGI API. Provided decorators helps with
 creating of RPC functions, timers, filemonitors.

Description: fast, self-healing application container server
 uWSGI presents a complete stack for networked/clustered web applications,
 implementing message/object passing, caching, RPC and process management.
 It uses the uwsgi protocol for all the networking/interprocess communications.
 .
 uWSGI can be run in preforking, threaded, asynchronous/evented modes and
 supports various forms of green threads/coroutines (such as uGreen, Greenlet,
 Fiber). uWSGI provides several methods of configuration: via command line,
 via environment variables, via XML, INI, YAML configuration files, via LDAP
 and more.
 .
 On top of all this, it is designed to be fully modular. This means that
 different plugins can be used in order to add compatibility with tons of
 different technology on top of the same core.
 .
 This package depends on uWSGI core binary and installs:
  * init.d script for running uWSGI daemon(s) with options defined in custom
    user-created configuration files
  * infrastructure for running daemons (like common locations of communication
    sockets, logs)
